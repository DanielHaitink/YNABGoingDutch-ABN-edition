# YNAB Going Dutch - ABN AMRO Edition - 

A CSV bank statement converter, created for the ABN AMRO. Completely written in javascript.

Select TAB files using the `Browse` button and it will download the converted file, super quick and easy! (Firefox will give you a prompt first. Chrome will ask you for permission if multiple files are downloaded)

The system will split unique account numbers in different output files.

Everything is done locally. Your information never leaves your own computer.

## How to get TAB files?
 - Log into your account on the ABN AMRO website.
 - Click on your account.
 - Select "Rekeningopties".
 - Select "Mutaties downloaden"
 - Choose "TXT" as format, set the desired period of time, select the accounts you want to download.
